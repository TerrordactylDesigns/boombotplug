#BOOMBOT Plug Edition

##TT is dead... Boom Bot is forever.

##NOTE: CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE DEV VERSION OF PLUGAPI, DO NOT USE THE NPM ONE, MANUALLY DOWNLOAD THE GITHUB DEV CODE

This is a heavy work in progress. Please see https://github.com/TerrordactylDesigns/boombot for commands. Several are not ported yet, DEAL WITH IT.

Note: due to plug attempting to parse all / commands they are being modified to . commands.
