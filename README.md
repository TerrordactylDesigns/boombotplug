#BOOMBOT Plug Edition

##TT is dead... Boom Bot is forever.


###NOTE - THIS REQUIRES [Forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) OR A SIMILAR PROCESS WATCHER TO WORK CURRENTLY

This is a heavy work in progress. Please see https://github.com/TerrordactylDesigns/boombot for commands. Several are not ported yet, DEAL WITH IT.

Note: due to plug attempting to parse all / commands they are being modified to . commands. Also /help was changed to .commands to mimic how the old Deathcore bot was.
